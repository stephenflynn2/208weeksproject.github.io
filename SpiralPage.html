            </div>

        <section class="body1">
            <div class="d1" id="spiBod">
                <h3 class="s1h3">How to use the Spiral</h3>
                <p>Each spiral contains activities for one year. You can download our 2025
                    spiral today! Cut along the heavy spiral line and tape the two spirals (parts A and B)
                    together (at July 14 and July 21) to form one long 52 week “ribbon.” Each week, tear off the
                    week you are in and do the activities listed. After 208 weeks we will, hopefully, have a happier
                    and more positive nation!
                </p>

           

                <h4 class="s1h4">Each week there are two activities listed:</h4>
               
                    <div class="row2">

                        <img src="Spiral.jpeg" class="img2">
                            <p>The first activity is the <strong class="strong1">Thank You Card Initiative</strong>. In alternative weeks, write a thank you card 
                                to a single individual making a difference. The person does not have to be a
                                politician or anyone political at all - could be a local hero or do-gooder. The other weeks are
                                spent planning who to write to. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The second activity is the <strong class="strong1">Happiness Initiative</strong>. This is an easy activity with a variety of facets:
                                learning about the world, helping or showing support to a marginalized group, working on the
                                environment, or just being kind. The goal is to make someone a little happier that week
                                (including yourself!).
                            </p>

                    </div>

                <h4 class="s1h4">Helpful Tips</h4>
                <ul class="tipsList">
                    <li>We suggest writing actual cards and not sending emails. </li>
                    <li>In our group that meets in a local cafe, we might send 6-8
                        cards to one person. Imagine getting a whole bunch of beautiful cards in one day! We’ve even
                        received thank you cards back - it’s a powerful effect.</li>
                    <li>Each local group can decide themselves
                        which person to write to OR everyone in the country can write to the same person. It’s more
                        effective if a number of cards arrive on the same day.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="s1h4">Too Easy/Too Hard?</h4>
                <p>If the spiral seems too simple and easy, it’s because we made it that way. You can
                    always add in more difficult activities. However, we have seen too many people burned out by
                    doing too much - especially activities they disliked. We are trying to avoid folks being
                    overwhelmed and falling into despair. Here’s a quote we love from <i>Braiding Sweetgrass:
                    Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge and the Teachings of Plants</i> by Robin Wall Kimmerer:
                </p>
                
                <p class="quoteP">
                    “Despair is paralysis. It robs us of agency. It blinds us to our own power and the power of
                     the earth. Environmental despair is a poison every bit as destructive as the methylated
                     mercury in the bottom of Onondaga Lake. But how can we submit to despair while the
                     land is saying "Help"? Restoration is a powerful antidote to despair.”
                </p>

              
                    <div>
                        <p>If you need to skip a week, don’t worry about it! Just try not to skip two weeks in a row. This is
                            important in forming a good habit as explained in <i>Atomic Habits</i> by James Clear.
                        </p>

                            you have any suggestions for weekly activities in our next year’s spiral, please email us and let
